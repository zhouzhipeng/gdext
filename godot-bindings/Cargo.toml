# Since features are additive, and we want the user to user prebuilt by default, we need to have `prebuilt-godot` as the
# default feature. However, it's not possible to _disable_ the prebuilt dependency when specifying `api-custom` (without
# requiring no-default-features), so we unfortunately still need to depend on prebuilt and just ignore it.
# The artifact generator explicitly excludes that though (to avoid a quasi-circular dependency back to its repo).
