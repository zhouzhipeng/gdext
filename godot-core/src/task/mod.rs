//! Integrates async rust code with the engine.
//!
//! This module contains:
//! - Implementations of [`Future`](std::future::Future) for [`Signal`](crate::builtin::Signal) and [`TypedSignal`](crate::registry::signal::TypedSignal).
//! - A way to [`spawn`] new async tasks by using the engine as the async runtime.
