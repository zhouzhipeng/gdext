/// Perform a best-effort single-pass formatting pass over a stream of tokens
/// and returning the formatted string.
///
/// "Best effort" here means:
/// - line breaks are added in certain points
///   - attributes
///   - braces `{}`
///   - semicolons `;`
///   - colons if they follow braces `..},`
/// - whitespace around punctuation is tried to be made as natural as possible
///   - `::` always stick to whatever comes after them `use ::crate::module::{..}`
///   - `$` is always prefix
///   - `!` tries to join with whatever comes after it, `!boolean`, `x != y`
///   - `&` tries to join with whatever comes after it, `&self`, `&'static`, `a && b`
///   - joint punctuation tries to stay joint
///   - if an identifier is followed by `.` or `()` then it's "sticky", `f()`, `s.x`
///
/// Current "flaws" (still compiles properly, just a bit ugly):
/// - Because of stickiness, bitwise AND doesn't really look nice, like `a &mask`.
///   Unless we check for all possible keywords (which would be costly), we
///   can't solve this.
/// - Also because of stickiness, macros are a bit weird, `name !`. If we made
///   all `!` stick to previous identifiers then we'd get `x!= y`.
///   Maybe that's a good trade-off if your code contains more not-equals checks
///   than macro invocations.
/// - anonymous function literals are a bit weird because the `|` don't have
///   joint spacing when they come out of a `TokenStream` and identifiers don't
///   have any spacing information attached, so it looks like `| arg |`.
///   Also, to know whether it's a chained bitwise or, a closure would need more
///   information. `move | arg | x`
/// - Because we don't keep track of what's a type and what's an expression,
///   generic parameters look a bit spaced out. `T < A, B >`
/// - `match` arms can be `<pat> => <expr>,` and there _should_ be a line break
///   after the `,` but because this only looks at one TokenKind at a time
///   and only keeps a single state, it's too much effort to keep track of which
///   `,` in a [`TokenTree`] should trigger a newline (it would involve a stack
///   of infos whether that group is in a match or not, detecting pattern etc)
/// - Because `,` can be used for function args (no-newline) and separators
///   in `struct` and `enum` definitons, those definitions are more awkward
///   and crammed into one line as a trade-off to make function calls and args
///   smoother.
///   Maybe it's worth to make ALL args on their own line, then function calls
///   get big, but `struct`s and `enum`s would be more natural?
